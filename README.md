# Air Quality Index

• Created an air quality analysis application which ask user for the required permission of location to get latitudes and longitudes of that region.
• The latitudes and longitudes we attain using the location permission are transferred to the API of OpenWeatherMaps and the required information is fetched using the OpenWeatherMaps servers.
• The application includes Air Quality Index level (1 to 5), NO2, PM 2.5, Temperature and Humidity in the particular region.
• The app has a beautiful Circular Completion bar in which the app AQI level is shown in the form of circular Bar in which max is taken as 5 (i.e., Very poor).
• The NO2 and PM (particulate matter) 2.5 have linear Completion Bars which show their values respectively.
• The Application Works in online mode.
• Project Code: https://github.com/Jaybhararia/Air_Quality_Index.git 
• Tech Used – Flutter, Dart, Android Studio and OpenWeatherMap API, some flutter plugins like geolocator, http and some custom fonts.
